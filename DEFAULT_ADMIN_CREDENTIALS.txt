   DEFAULT ADMIN USER CREATED!
========================================

Your backend now automatically creates a default admin user!

ADMIN LOGIN CREDENTIALS:
------------------------
Email:    admin@priceapproval.com
Password: Admin@123456

IMPORTANT: Change this password after first login!

========================================

WHAT TO DO NOW:
---------------

1. WAIT for Render to deploy (5-10 minutes)
   - Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
   - Check your backend service
   - Wait for "Deploy live" status

2. CHECK BACKEND LOGS to verify admin was created:
   - Click your backend service
   - Click "Logs" tab
   - Look for these messages:
     ✅ Users table created/verified
     ✅ Price approvals table created/verified
     ✅ Default admin user created!
     📧 Email: admin@priceapproval.com
     🔑 Password: Admin@123456

3. OPEN YOUR APP:
   https://price-approval.onrender.com
   
   (First visit may take 30-60 seconds - cold start)

4. LOGIN with these credentials:
   Email: admin@priceapproval.com
   Password: Admin@123456

5. TEST the app:
   - Create a price approval request
   - View dashboard
   - Approve/reject requests

========================================

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

If login still fails:
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify DATABASE_URL is set in Render
- Make sure backend status is "Live"
- Wait 60 seconds for cold start

If you see "admin user already exists" in logs:
- The admin was created successfully!
- Just login with the credentials above
